I’m passionate about technology and innovation, driven by curiosity and a desire to understand how things work beneath the surface. As a self-taught engineer at heart and an architect by profession, I’ve always combined strategic thinking with hands‑on experience to turn ideas into working solutions in real‑world environments.

Over the past decade I’ve worked across cloud, platform, security and DevOps, using technologies like Azure, OpenStack, Kubernetes, Terraform, Bicep, Ansible, Linux and IAM solutions such as Entra ID and Keycloak. Because I genuinely understand both infrastructure and software development, I can see how systems behave under the hood while also understanding how teams build, deploy and operate applications. That helps me design solutions that are technically solid, security‑aware and actually implementable by the people who have to run them.

I enjoy solving complex problems, designing solutions that are pragmatic and future‑ready, and helping people achieve their goals through collaboration and trust. Continuous learning is part of who I am; I like figuring things out myself, experimenting with new ideas and using those lessons to make better decisions that balance business needs with technical and security realities.

My focus is on architecting solutions that are practical, adaptable and built to last – always designed with security in mind and leveraging modern approaches such as cloud-agnostic technologies and automation – while keeping an eye on the bigger picture and the details that matter.
