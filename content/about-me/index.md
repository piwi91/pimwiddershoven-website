I’m an IT / Solution Architect and engineer at heart, working at the intersection of cloud, platform, security and DevOps. For more than a decade I’ve been designing and building solutions that need to work in real‑world, often complex environments.

I’m analytical, like to keep a clear overview and work in a structured way. I enjoy figuring things out myself, continuously learning and experimenting, and that’s how I end up with innovative, result‑oriented solutions.

I started programming as a kid and later studied network infrastructure design at Zuyd University, which naturally led me into roles where software and infrastructure come together – what we now call DevOps. Because I genuinely understand both domains, I can see how systems behave under the hood while also understanding how teams develop, deploy and operate applications.

Over the years I’ve worked with technologies such as Azure, OpenStack, Kubernetes, Terraform, Bicep, Ansible, Linux and IAM solutions like Entra ID and Keycloak. My work includes designing and implementing the architecture and underlying cloud environment for a SaaS solution on OpenStack, as well as acting as a trusted technical advisor for business and DevOps teams in an enterprise financial environment.
