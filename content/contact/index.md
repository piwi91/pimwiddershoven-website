If you’d like to get in touch, whether it’s about cloud and platform architecture, DevOps, security, a project you’re working on or something else you think I might be interested in, feel free to reach out.

The easiest way to reach me is by email:

 __pim [at] widdershoven [dot] nl__ 

I will get back to you as soon as I can
